I want to say thank you to the developers from these projects:
https://github.com/imRohan/pantry-node
https://github.com/zobjobs/api/tree/main/node.js

I used the functions created in these projects to build my script.

The primary purpose of this script is to detour the CORS Error when I try to fetch data from zobjobs API in my React application.
